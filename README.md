# Node Vue App

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Build the frontend
```
npm run build
```

### Run the node server
```
npm start
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Navigate the APP
See [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Notes
The important folders are
- nodesrc: this is where you add nodejs related files like controllers, application configs, models, etc
- src: this is the frontend related files (in this case VUEJS)

Please do not forget to run ```npm run build``` because the ```dist``` folder is ignored
